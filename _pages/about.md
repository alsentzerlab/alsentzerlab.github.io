The Alsentzer Lab is an interdiscplinary research group in the Department of Biomedical Data Science at Stanford University. The mission the lab is to leverage machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) to augment clinical decision-making and expand access to high-quality healthcare. Our work operates at the intersection of computer science, informatics, and medicine. We combine diverse clinical data, such as electronic health records (EHRs) and genomic data, to deliver actionable insights to clinicians, researchers, and patients. We also develop new methods to integrate biomedical knowledge into machine learning algorithms.
We are motivated by the question: how can we design trustworthy machine learning methods that excel in settings with limited annotated data and can be deployed safely and effectively into clinical workflows?Â 

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.
Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
