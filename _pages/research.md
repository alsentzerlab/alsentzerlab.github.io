Our research focuses on addressing the challenges of translating machine learning (ML) approaches into clinical practice through three interconnected themes. Each theme is grounded in real-world clinical applications.

**Integration of domain knowledge.** How can we effectively incorporate the rich, multi-modal biomedical knowledge found in structured sources (e.g., knowledge graphs) and unstructured text into ML algorithms? Our goal is to leverage this domain knowledge to develop robust, generalizable decision-support systems that align with clinical needs.

**Learning with limited annotated data.** Given the scarcity of annotated clinical data, what strategies can enable the development of high-performing ML models? We explore approaches such as self-supervised learning and the integration of domain expertise to create clinically useful foundation models that function effectively even with limited data.

**Responsible machine learning.** How can we design and evaluate ML systems that promote equitable healthcare for all populations? Our work focuses on developing and implementing human-in-the-loop systems to augment medical decision-making while emphasizing fairness, transparency, and patient safety.
