We are actively recruiting graduate students, undergraduates, postdoctoral fellows, and collaborators to join our lab. Our mission is to build a diverse and collaborative lab community, bringing together computer scientists, clinicians, and statisticians to translate machine learning into the clinic. We especially encourage individuals from nontraditional or underrepresented backgrounds to reach out. Below, you'll find position-specific details on how to get involved.

**PhD Applicants:** Applications to Stanford are handled by academic departments rather than individual researchers. You can view [departmental admission sites](https://gradadmissions.stanford.edu/explore-programs) for information regarding admissions for each department. If you’re interested in our lab, feel free to mention it in your application materials. Accepted students will have the opportunity to rotate with labs during their first year to find the best match for their interests. I will generally be recruiting students from Biomedical Data Science, Computer Science, and Bioengineering. 

Note: Due to the high volume of inquiries, I may not be able to respond to all emails regarding PhD admissions prior to acceptance.

**Admitted Graduate Students:** If you have been admitted to a graduate program at Stanford and are exploring potential advisors, I encourage you to email me directly to discuss your interests.

**Stanford Undergraduates:** We welcome self-driven undergraduates with strong programming skills to join our lab. If you’re interested, please email me with the following:

- A brief description of your research interests
- Your resume
- A copy of your transcript

**Postdoctoral Fellows:** We are currently seeking 1-2 postdoctoral fellows to join the lab. Ideal candidates will have:

- A PhD (or be nearing completion of one) in computer science, biomedical informatics, data science, or a related field
- Research experience in machine learning and/or natural language processing (NLP), especially in clinical applications

If this sounds like you, please apply by filling out [this form](https://bit.ly/alsentzerlab-app). The start date is flexible, and we will be reviewing applications on a rolling basis.

**Clinicians:** Collaborations with clinicians and clinical informatics fellows are central to our research. We’re always eager to translate ML and NLP methods into clinical practice. If you’re interested in collaborating, I’d love to hear from you.

**Other Collaborators**: Our lab values interdisciplinary collaboration. If you have a project idea or opportunity, please email me with a detailed description of the project and how you envision working together.
